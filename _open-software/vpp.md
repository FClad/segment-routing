## Introduction  

FD.io (Fast data - Input/Output) is a collection of several projects and libraries to amplify the transformation that began with Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to support flexible, programmable and composable services on a generic hardware platform. FD.io offers the Software Defined Infrastructure developer community a landing site with multiple projects fostering innovations in software-based packet processing towards the creation of high-throughput, low-latency and resource-efficient IO services suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and deployment environments (bare metal, VM, container). 

A key component is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) library donated by Cisco. This code is already running in products on the market today.  The VPP library is highly modular, allowing for new graph nodes to be easily “plugged in” without changes to the underlying code base. This gives developers the potential to easily build any number of packet processing solutions with varying forwarding graphs.

The Segment Routing team at Cisco has funded an implementation of Segment Routing for IPv6 in VPP. The objective of this implementation is to provide an outstanding open software support for SR with the same behavior specs as the different hardware platforms such as IOS XR and IOS XE.
