Greater interaction will help service providers optimize their network infrastructure, and more importantly, offer new services that can generate incremental revenues. The Cisco® Application Engineered Routing solution can raise this interaction to a previously unachievable level. This simple and scalable architecture uses customer network assets and augments them with network programmability capabilities that allow applications to program the network, delivering end-to-end, per-flow policy from the data center through the WAN to end users.",

      "content": "AbstractIn this talk, we would look at Segment Routing traffic engineering primarily focused around inter-area/multi-domain traffic engineering. We will look at how certain approaches with Segment Routing can help in solving the challenges associated with multi-domain traffic engineering in a simple and scalable manner.We will look into various components associated with multi-domain traffic engineering and approaches to solve multi-domain traffic engineering.  PCE  PCEP  On Demand Next-Hop  BGP SRTE Dynamics  PCE HASegment Routing (SR) works by encoding a path across a network as an ordered list of segments, which may be links, multi-hop tunnels between nodes, and more. SR uses today’s dataplane technologies without any modification, supports MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6, and requires only very modest changes to existing routing protocols. SR is also fully documented in IETF drafts with both multi-vendor and multi-operator contribution, thereby increasing the likelihood of interoperable implementations. Segment Routing allows operators to program new service topologies without the traditional concerns around network state explosion. Using SDN procedures, the head end can program a ordered list of segment identifiers (MPLS labels, IPv6 routing headers) that enable explicit source routing. This can allow for service level differentiation, potentially providing new enhanced service offering opportunities for operators. SR can be introduced slowly into a network without any flag day events, thereby minimizing disruption.VideoSlides",

      "content": "IntroductionFD.io (Fast data - Input/Output) is a collection of several projects and libraries to amplify the transformation that began with Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to support flexible, programmable and composable services on a generic hardware platform. FD.io offers the Software Defined Infrastructure developer community a landing site with multiple projects fostering innovations in software-based packet processing towards the creation of high-throughput, low-latency and resource-efficient IO services suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and deployment environments (bare metal, VM, container).A key component is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) library donated by Cisco. This code is already running in products on the market today.  The VPP library is highly modular, allowing for new graph nodes to be easily “plugged in” without changes to the underlying code base. This gives developers the potential to easily build any number of packet processing solutions with varying forwarding graphs.Along with VPP, FD-io leverages DPDK capabilities in support of additional projects including NSH_ SFC, Honeycomb, and ONE to accelerate the NFV data planes. The FD.io projects are aligning to other key open source initiatives in support of NFV and SDN such as OPNFV.  See the Fast data Stack (FTS) project proposal with OPNFV overall objectives, the proposal calls for an optional virtualized data plane integrated with  OpenStack and OpenDaylight (see FastDataStacks).Configure IPv6 Segment Routing with VPP  https#//wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/Configure_IPv6_Segment_Routing",

      "title": "Traffic duplication through segmentable disjoint paths",
      "content": "AbstractUltra-low latency is a key component of safety-critical operations such as robot-assisted remote surgery or financial applications where every single millisecond counts. In this paper, we show how network operators can build upon the recently proposed Segment Routing architecture to provide a traffic duplication service to better serve the users of such demanding applications. We propose the first implementation of Segment Routing in the Linux kernel and leverage it to provide a traffic duplication service that sends packets over disjoint paths. Our experiments show that with such a service existing TCP stacks can preserve latency in the presence of packet losses. We also propose and evaluate an efficient algorithm that computes disjoint paths that can be realised by using segments. Our evaluation with real and synthetic network topologies shows that our proposed algorithms perform well in large networks.  http#//inl.info.ucl.ac.be/system/files/paper_9.pdf",

      "title": "A Declarative and Expressive Approach to Control Forwarding Paths in Carrier-Grade Networks",
      "content": "AbstractSDN simplifies network management by relying ondeclarativity (high-level interface) and expressiveness(network flexibility). We propose a solution to support those features while preserving high robustness and scalability as needed in carrier-grade networks. Our solution is based on (i) a two-layer architecture separating connectivity and optimization tasks; and (ii) a centralized optimizer called DEFO, which translates high-level goals expressed almost in natural language into compliant network configurations.Our evaluation on real and synthetic topologies shows that DEFO improves the state of the art by  achieving better trade-offs for classic goals covered by previous works,  supporting a larger set of goals (refined traffic engineering and servicechaining), and  optimizing large ISP networks in few seconds.We also quantify the gains of our implementation,running Segment Routing on top of IS-IS,over possible alternatives (RSVP-TE and OpenFlow).Renaud Hartert ∗ , Stefano Vissicchio ∗, Pierre Schaus ∗, Olivier Bonaventure ∗,Clarence Filsfils † , Thomas Telkamp †, Pierre Francois ‡∗ Université catholique de Louvain † Cisco Systems, Inc. ‡ IMDEA Networks Institute∗ firstname.lastname@uclouvain.be † {cfilsfil,thtelkam}@cisco.com ‡ pierre.francois@imdea.org  http#//conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2015/pdf/papers/p15.pdf",

Kodialam and T. V. Lakshman (Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, USA)  http#//infocom2016.ieee-infocom.org/program/main-technical-programSegment Routing ArchitectureAbstractNetwork operators anticipate the offering of an increasing variety of cloud-based services with stringent Service Level Agreements. Technologies currently supporting IP networks however lack the flexibility and scalability properties to realize such evolution. In this article, we present Segment Routing (SR), a new network architecture aimed at filling this gap, driven by use-cases defined by network operators. SR implements the source routing and tunneling paradigms, letting nodes steer packets over paths using a sequence of instructions (segments) placed in the packet header. As such, SR allows the implementation of routing policies without per-flow entries at intermediate routers. This paper introduces the SR architecture, describes its related ongoing standardization efforts, and reviews the main use-cases envisioned by network operators.Published in# Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2015 IEEEDate of Conference# 6-10 Dec. 2015  http#//ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7417124/",
